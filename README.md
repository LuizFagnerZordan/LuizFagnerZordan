- 📫 How to reach me - luiz.zordan@blip.ai
- 😄 Pronouns: he/her
- ⚡ Fun fact:  The fact that I don't like Luiz in my name is because I think it's too serious, too heavy lol

And the funny fact is that there is a generation of `Luiz` in my family... my great-grandmother, my grandmother, my uncles, myself and my younger cousins ​​have a generation that has `Luiz` in their name - but it doesn't stop there. oh - all of Luiz, including me, have worked at the cemetery lol

In other words, from my great-grandmother to me, who broke this cycle, I found it in the cemetery... I only helped my grandmother in seasonal events throughout the year, and I really liked it as a child, but I followed other professional paths
